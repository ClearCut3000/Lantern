# Lantern
## Lantern is a simple app that is made for educational purposes and helps to see in the dark.
### After launching, the main screen is painted white and is used for lighting by itself.

### It can also consistently change its color to black (or switched off), red, yellow and green when clicked anywhere.

### In the center of the screen there is a minimalistic switch that is responsible for turning on/off the phone's camera flashlight. 
### It is always in the center of any screen - thanks to autolayout.
